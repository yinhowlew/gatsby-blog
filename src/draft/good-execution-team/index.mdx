What does it mean when we say a company has good execution? 

There are many many books and literatures on what is great execution for a team and a company. One thing that always stood out to me 

in I want to focus on today is: decision-making.

Principles of decision-making


####  Speed (Reid)

lets table it for now...lets circle back later


When faced with a set of options, Reid Hoffman frequently will make a provisional decision instinctually based on the current information. Then he will note what additional information he would need to disprove his provisional decision and go get that. 

What many do instead — at their own peril — is encounter a situation in which they have limited information, punt on the decision until they gather more information, and endure an information-gathering process that takes longer than expected. Meanwhile, the world changes.

According to Reid Hoffman, Speeding up the process of making decision

Speed is a decision with trade-off that you need to accept, namely mistakes. If you move quickly, there will be mistakes borne of haste. If you’re a manager and care seriously about speed, you’ll need to tell your people you’re willing to accept the tradeoffs.

#### Simplify
simplicity enables speed and better decision making

when long list of pros and cons...seek a single decisive reason

Making the complex simple does not mean ignoring complexity. Reid is a nuanced thinker who does not shy away from detail, second order effects, exception cases, and so on. But especially in a group decision-making process where there are various points of view, it’s important for the leader to distill and frame the option set with simplicity. Wrestle with complexity, yes, but frame and commit to a decision that’s simple enough for everyone to understand and act on.

The team, lost in Groundhog Day, continues to debate last month's decision because they don't agree with it. 

ACCORDING TO SENIOR MANAGER A NGUYEN,  my team's issues is everything is a priority and so then nothing is a priority. We need to pinpoint what are the 3 things we need to focus on, and everything will be fine

2359 media:  yearly strategy and focus on 3 things. 3 things only.


#### One-way Door Decision vs Two-way Door Decision  (BEZOS)

"Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible -- one-way doors -- and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don't like what you see on the other side, you can't get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions.

But most decisions aren't like that -- they are changeable, reversible -- they're two-way doors. If you've made a sub-optimal Type 2 decision, you don't have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups. 

As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavyweight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. We'll have to figure out how to fight that tendency."

All decisions are rigorously considered and debated.

Expensive, hard-to-reverse decisions are rigorously debated. 
Cheap, easily-reversible decisions are made quickly. 
(Most decisions are the latter.)

#### TBD

measure
quick information flow
quick decision flow

prioritization and decision-making:  impact x effort x one/two-way doors

Instead of KIV (not this word) and think about it, set up a concrete mutual action plan and timeline to gather information etc. If it’s not important enough to do that, then it doesn’t require wasting the team mental space on it 


Good execution:
Once a decision is made, everyone moves in lock step on implementation. Only substantial new information reopens the case.
