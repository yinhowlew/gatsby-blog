write about Reducing Uncertainty


<p style={{fontSize: "0.7em", fontStyle: "italic"}}>all info accurate as of Nov 2021</p>

this is an em dash —

two jobs
time is limited
high leverage
best project is time-boxed and you are clear what is failure and success. and even fail, you win


write about RETENTION
In my current role as Head of Product Growth, 
Write about Acquisition growth is meaningless, just prolonging an inevitable death, if there is no retention
negative churn

IMPLEMENT A SEARCH??

I read online that confirmation bias isn't real. I knew it!



Another way to shed light on confirmation bias, here's a classic example of logic:

> 𝑃 ⇒ 𝑄, i.e. if P, then Q.

Suppose a statement goes "if YH is drunk, then YH is happy".

If YH is happy, can we then infer YH is drunk?

no,  there may be other circumstances that makes YH happy (e.g. good food).
This is a logicl fallacy called modus morons
If A then B
B, therefore A
if it rains, ground is wet
ground is wet, therefor we infer it rains.


this is a case of modus tollens. (if P then Q. Not Q, therefore not P)

Chick-Fil-A is franchise, but different model: acceptance rate lower than Stanford; only initial franchisee fee of 10k instead of 50k of others; a lot of drive throughs; close on Sunday; private company

4k sku only; no need to restock much
it is an ecosystem for the members; not just grocery
resistent to Amazon

- limited selection, no online, no delivery, massive line but quick, no sales, no branded goods (80% are private label goods), no loyalty card, no ads, no self-checkout; 4k SKU vs 30k-100k
- interlocking advantages/moat -> see injae book
(IF POSSIBLE, add financial analysis too??)




Some startups make it a badge of pride to not spend a dollar on ads, while some go blitz on day one.

- For retailers, whether focusing on the widest selection (Walmart), or limited SKUs but quality products to reduce decision fatigue (CostCo, Trader Joe's)
- For B2B products, some engage channel sales partnership
- Some go by D2C, some hit success by putting themselves on Amazon and Walmart.
- to spend on ads or not
- grow by acquisition, grow by blitz

book about best CEOs - example...contrarian




also, when a success story shares wisdom and lessons, it is easy to give too much credit to it. 
With the benefit of hindsight, it is a lot easier to look back and map out the strategy and wisdom  - but more likely than not, in the arena, businesses are making experiments, and doubling down on those that work.
