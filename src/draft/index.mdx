1)
why Direct-to-Consumer like Casper failed -->  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcNbIm0fRxk
honest company, everlane, dollar shave club, brandless, Away (luggage)
Casper (CSPR) -- turned down 900MM acquisition from target. But IPO at 450MM. Sold private to a buyout firm for $286
gross profit margin: 50%
but spent 91% of gross profit into advertising
online ads (and influencer marketing) have evolved since 2014. It was very affordable then. But now very competitive (not just tech startups, but big giants like proctor and gamble), driving ad costs
2019, CPC for FB rose by 90%
e.g. Now, $5-7 CPA?
All DTC startups like Casper has no inherent platform and marketing (since by dTc definition, they are forgoing middlemen). So it is all about CPA & LTV
Casper spends $275 to $300 to acquire a new customer
now more copycats, competing in the same online channels, targetting same demographics, same ad keywords
175 online mattress companies
This ends up a downward spiral / vicious cycle of escalating ad to stay competitive and losing more money
no light at the end of tunnel.
avg american changes mattress 9 to 10 years
true consumer retention power will only come in 2025 (since first batch of users are 2015)
no amounnt of advertising is gonna change the underlying market reality and consumer behavior

now, ironic thing is fastest channel of sales growth is retail - 74% growth YoY, compared to 20% of DtC
the very thing Casper wanted to disrupt, they are joining. (refer to zeigeist of O2O...)
same for Everlane and Away. They are now opening stores, working with big retailers like Target to put their products on shelves.
For a physical product,  online only growth has an upperbound...due to competitive digital marketing landscape
no online-only (DTC) is profitable
Now, they need to be open to multiple different channels...

But if it is more than mattress. If it is the first brand you think about on your bedroom, household:  bedframe, furniture, couch



can speed be a competitive advantage


two jobs
time is limited
high leverage
best project is time-boxed and you are clear what is failure and success. and even fail, you win


IMPLEMENT A SEARCH??









Another way to shed light on confirmation bias, here's a classic example of logic:

> 𝑃 ⇒ 𝑄, i.e. if P, then Q.

Suppose a statement goes "if YH is drunk, then YH is happy".

If YH is happy, can we then infer YH is drunk?

no,  there may be other circumstances that makes YH happy (e.g. good food).
This is a logicl fallacy called modus morons
If A then B
B, therefore A
if it rains, ground is wet
ground is wet, therefor we infer it rains.


this is a case of modus tollens. (if P then Q. Not Q, therefore not P)

Chick-Fil-A is franchise, but different model: acceptance rate lower than Stanford; only initial franchisee fee of 10k instead of 50k of others; a lot of drive throughs; close on Sunday; private company

4k sku only; no need to restock much
it is an ecosystem for the members; not just grocery
resistent to Amazon

Trader Joe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_QPClXo5MU
- limited selection, no online, no delivery, massive line but quick, no sales, no branded goods (80% are private label goods), no loyalty card, no ads, no self-checkout; 4k SKU vs 30k-100k
- interlocking advantages/moat -> see injae book
(IF POSSIBLE, add financial analysis too??)




Some startups make it a badge of pride to not spend a dollar on ads, while some go blitz on day one.

- For retailers, whether focusing on the widest selection (Walmart), or limited SKUs but quality products to reduce decision fatigue (CostCo, Trader Joe's)
- For B2B products, some engage channel sales partnership
- Some go by D2C, some hit success by putting themselves on Amazon and Walmart.
- to spend on ads or not
- grow by acquisition, grow by blitz

also, when a success story shares wisdom and lessons, it is easy to give too much credit to it. 
With the benefit of hindsight, it is a lot easier to look back and map out the strategy and wisdom  - but more likely than not, in the arena, businesses are making experiments, and doubling down on those that work.
