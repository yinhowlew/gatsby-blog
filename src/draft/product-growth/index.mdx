By late 2019, Quibi announced it had sold out its first-year advertising inventory, which amounted to $150 millio

Raised $1.75 billion from investors

seen 1.7 million downloads of its app in its release week

saw 300,000 downloads and "hit No. 3 in the App Store" on its launch day

3.5 million installs
1.3 million were active users

The problem that Quibi could never address was, “Why do I need this?” Katzenberg and Whitman repeatedly said “we’re not competing with Netflix,” but Quibi was competing with Netflix and every other app. Without a library of great content that other streamers have or social capabilities that other apps use, Quibi needed one show to get people to open the app. That never happened. There was no reason to ever open Quibi. A streaming service needs to feel essential to people’s daily lives to survive; Quibi never even made the case to get people to download.



Vanity metrics
installs
signups
users

Lagging metrics
revenue
profit

good metrics
define what your DAU and MAU (Active Users) mean. 
effective activer user (users who have done X)
retention numbers




lies, damn lies, and statistics

Give example of a company in trouble but select stats that look great vs actual

Engagement YouTube prioritize quantity over quality


xG xA and chance created instead of goals and possession
Latter are outcome, and in a single game, might not reflect performance


write about RETENTION
In my current role as Head of Product Growth, 
Write about Acquisition growth is meaningless, just prolonging an inevitable death, if there is no retention
negative churn


revenue is a lagging success indicator. It's the ultimate, but it doesn't give insights

Look at my Growth doc, and new monetization doc

why is my product not growing?

gamification is a booster, not a fix

underlying why.  Getting users to download or sign up for some can be easy. But getting users to come back -- you are competing with every other entertainment and form of distraction.  If there is no strong raison d'etre, your retention curve

installs number is not it. Users opening the app for the first time is not. Signup is not. Finished onboarding is not.
Though we need to measure the funnel. When is my user considered activated

measuring active users (DAU/MAU)
don't just use session etc. Use things that show users are activated (e.g. viewing a news page)


vanity metrics vs actionable metrics
"users" or visitor --> AU
effective active user --> user who did something
"new users" --> users who are properly activated, or return at least once
engaged / activated users --> users who have reached aha! moment
also, download is not new users



Good metrics should also fit the context.

Acquisition, Activation / Conversion, Short Engagement, Long Retention

Activation: not just signup, but actually reach a point where they understood the value of the product. Finishing the first set of Mellows (each set is 10 curated images). The funnel includes: onboarding, signup, calibration (evaluating 10 images), setting timing of PN, quick in-app tool tips

Short-term retention (IOI): how many users come back and finish the 3rd set of daily Mellows. We have changed this metrics a few times (from viewing how many images), but when we run some queries, we find finishing 3rd set is the best predictor of retention next few months. They have reached an "aha!" moment. When they start getting images they like. Other secondary features: % of good ratings (from 0.6 to 1.0). how many favorites out of 100 images. Indicator that they like content. How often they navigate out of the guided flow (discovery). Check out artists, view more. All these metrics give us a focus and foundation on how to improve engagement.

Long-term retention: artist follow. Share. Donation.
