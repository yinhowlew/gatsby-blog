write about RETENTION
In my current role as Head of Product Growth, 
Write about Acquisition growth is meaningless, just prolonging an inevitable death, if there is no retention
negative churn


revenue is a lagging success indicator. It's the ultimate, but it doesn't give insights

Look at my Growth doc, and new monetization doc

why is my product not growing?

gamification is a booster, not a fix

underlying why.  Getting users to download or sign up for some can be easy. But getting users to come back -- you are competing with every other entertainment and form of distraction.  If there is no strong raison d'etre, your retention curve

installs number is not it. Users opening the app for the first time is not. Signup is not. Finished onboarding is not.
Though we need to measure the funnel. When is my user considered activated

measuring active users (DAU/MAU)
don't just use session etc. Use things that show users are activated (e.g. viewing a news page)


vanity metrics vs actionable metrics
"users" or visitor --> AU
effective active user --> user who did something
"new users" --> users who are properly activated, or return at least once
engaged / activated users --> users who have reached aha! moment
also, download is not new users
