It doesn’t matter how many shots you’ve missed.

You will only be remembered by your hits and home runs.

...

Entrepreneurs will only be known for their one break-out success, and not be remembered for their hundreds of failed ventures.

We do not compile highlights of NBA players missing their crutch shots; we only remember the buzzer-beating shots that changed a game.

...

Whether you are an athlete, an entrepreneur, a writer, an artist, or a poker player, you need to give yourself the opportunities to make your *magnum opus*, your legacy-defining work.

The only way is to **keep taking shots**.

And one day, all your failures and mistakes will merely be a **footnote**.
