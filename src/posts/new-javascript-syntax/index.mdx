<h3>1 ) Optional chaining ?.</h3>

We have a deeply nested user object below.

```js
let user = {
	favorite: {
		shoes: {
			size: "10.5",
			brand: "Nike"
		}
	}
}

user.favorite?.shoes?.brand // "Nike"

// error
user.favorite.shirts.brand // TypeError: Cannot read property 'brand' of undefined

// no error
user.favorite?.shirts?.brand // undefined
```
<br />

If we want to get user's favourite shirts brand, we would normally write
user.favourite.shirt.brand.

But if user has no favourite shirt (shirts property does not exist), getting shirts.brand will return error.

- If we use optional chaining - user.favorite?.shirts?.brand - we will get undefined instead of error.

- This is useful for us to call a deeply nested object properties without having an error **if any intermediate property in the chain doesn't exist** or is undefined.

<br />

<h3>2 ) Nullish coalescing ??</h3>

X ?? Y - Y will be evaluated if X is null or undefined

Prior to this, we use X || Y for short-circuit evaluation. 

But the issue for || is that X will be evaluated as false if it is 0 or empty string.

If we need to **treat 0 or empty string differently** from null or undefined, we should use ?? instead of ||.

```js
let siblings = 0

alert(siblings || "please indicate your no. of siblings")
// "please indicate your no. of siblings"

alert(siblings ?? "please indicate your no. of siblings")
// 0
```

<br />

<h3>3 ) Computed property name</h3>

It allows us to use expression to dynamically generate property names within object literals.

```js
let fruit = prompt("which is your favorite fruit?") //apple

let basket = {
	[fruit]: 5,
	[fruit + "juice"]: 10
}

basket.apple // 5
basket.applejuice // 10
```

<br />

<h3>4 ) Property existence test</h3>

This is not new, but a neat way to test if a property exists.

```js
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 10
}

"name" in user // true
"address" in user // false
```

<br />

<h3>5 ) Array.find </h3>

Find the first element in an array that returns true and returns that element.

```js
const users = [
	{
		name: "John",
		age: 20
	},
	{
		name: "Daisy",
		age: 26
	}
]

users.find((user) => {
	return user.name === "Daisy"
})
// {name: "Daisy", age: 26}

```
