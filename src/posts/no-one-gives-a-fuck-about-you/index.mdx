As functioning members of the society, we are culturally conditioned to pay attention to others’ judgment of us.

Sometimes this grows into a crippling fear, an anxiety, of how others think of us.

…

As I grow older, I am starting to realise: most people are busy dealing with their own shits, and **they really don’t think much about you**, if at all.

...

"Those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind”

For the handful of people – your parents, your best friends – whose judgments matter to you, they will always be your cheerleader and wish the best for you, no matter how you are doing.

If you are my reader, know this - I probably don't think about you at all. If I care enough to think about you, I am likely your cheerleader and want the best for you.

…

You are by far the harshest judgment of your own self.

No one gives a fuck about you.

Start freeing yourself from your fear and anxiety.
