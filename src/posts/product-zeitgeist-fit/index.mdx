> Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come - Victor Hugo

Zeitgeist is a term used by German philosopher Hegel to denote "world-spirit", a force that dominates and shapes an epoch in our history.

The term has recently been adopted by Silicon Valley, for instance in Product-Zeitgeist-Fit (PZF) – something you achieve when your product resonates with the mood of the times, such that every stakeholder (users, investors, partners) conspire to help you win.

It explains why the same idea might fail at a time but explode at another (e.g. grocery delivery, Tik Tok, etc), sometimes through no execution fault or strength of the startup.

There are nuanced differences in PZF between different markets / cultures (e.g. US vs Asia). But here are a few generic ones I’m looking at:

1. Remote Work / Collaboration 

2. Skill re-inventing / upgrading & Income Share Agreement

3.  De-coupling of our identity and life from traditional 9-to-5 work: e.g. being 
independent on insurance and investment plan, need for new space for socialising and 
support for non-traditional workers.

4. Fantasy sports & e-sports betting

5. [MLS](https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2019/12/24/seven-tectonic-shifts-transformed-mls-2010s-charles-boehm) – it’s going to be the biggest market and league, overtaking Europe

6. Parenting and child education for millennials

7. Anything that addresses Millennial angst and mid-life crises

8. Related to #3 and #7, millennial’s retirement and asset planning - especially because our generation's perspective on house and asset ownership might be shifting away from our parents'. 

9. (2020 Covid update:)  Automation and Universal Basic Income (UBI)
