To me, email is the most **intimate** medium of communication. 

It allows space and time for thoughts to ruminate, and not be drifted away in ephemeral news/chat feeds.

And it is always a pleasant surprise to receive emails from friends who take the efforts to write instead of using instant messages.

Of course, it is a challenge to keep our mailbox uncluttered in today's world, with constant clamor of attention from brands we don't really care about.

...

I like reading newsletters - much more than reading news, which can be stressful and noisy most of the times. They keep me inspired and informed.

Over my adult life, I have subscribed and unsubscribed >100 of them. Here are some that have stood the test of time:


<h3>Business</h3>

[Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/)- subscribed for more than 10 years. his emails are often concise and impactful.

[NYTimes DealBook](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/DK) by Andrew Ross SorkinÂ - the gold standard for business news. the only news I read regularly.


<h3>Tech / Strategy</h3>

[Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/) by Ben Thompson -  the top tech strategy blog/newsletter. Not an easy read, but the analysis is great.

[Ben Evan](https://www.ben-evans.com/essays) - similar to Stratechery, but shorter/more palatable essays

[Two Truths and a Take](https://danco.substack.com/) by Alex Danco - general tech writings

[Ben Casnocha](https://casnocha.com/blog) - writer / VC on a broad range of topics
