PLO is my favorite variant of poker. While it looks deceptively similar to Hold’em, PLO is, in practice, a game with completely different complexity and heuristics.

For NLHE players recently discovering PLO, applying the same **intuitions and mental models** from Hold’em to PLO is a sure-fire way to get yourself burnt.

 <br />

Here are a few quick pointers to correct your mental model:

1)

While you can only use 2 out of 4 hole cards in PLO to form the best hand at show down, in essence you have 6 combinations (any 2 combi out of 4).

Think of it as **different angles of attacking** the board.

If your hand is single-dimensional (e.g. just a bad naked KK), you have only 1 way to attack the board, whereas if your hand is multi-dimensional (e.g. AKJ9 double suited), you have 6 ways to connect to the board

Hence, in hand selection, don’t get married preflop to single-dimensional hand. The most common trap to NLHE players is overvaluing naked high pairs (QQ+) pre flop.

This principle of multiple angles of attack applies to post-flop as well: you want to build and play a bigger pot if all 4 of your cards are connecting well and attacking the flop/turn in symphony.

If you only have a naked 2 pairs or worse end of a straight on a dynamic flop, and your hand can’t improve further, it is best to keep the pot small or even fold if the action gets too heated.

<br />

2)

In Hold’em, we don’t sweat too much about coolers (e.g. nut flush over 2nd nut flush, house over house, set over set) since it happens infrequently, and also because even if we only hold second nut, our opponent’s range still consists of many hands we can beat.

In PLO, the frequency of having coolers and 2 strong hands clashing is much higher. This is because your opponent has more hole cards, and mathematically more combinations of hands.

In a heads-up pot in Omaha, there are 12 combinations of hands in play (versus just 2 in Hold’em).

In practice, what this means is:

- **relative hand strengths in PLO are way stronger.** E.g. in holdem, sometimes you can take 3 streets of actions with just over-pair. But in PLO, with just bottom 2 pairs without chance of improving,  you might have to fold to a single bet.
- Another common situation: if 4 players see a flop of A77, and you don’t have 7, there is ~50% chance another player has a 7.
- Over-trip is significantly more valuable than under-trip. E.g. if you have 789J, on a flop of 773, you can be comfortable putting more in the pot since you are drawing to the nut; whereas on a board of Q77, you need to be extremely cautious as you hand might be drawing dead.
- **don’t go bonkers with non-nutted hand** (e.g. lower house, K high flush, lower set). If you have a naked set of 4 in T84ds, you might not want to raise if you are deep stacked.
 
<br />

3)

You need to absolutely drill this into your mind: PLO is a game of nut and **nut draw**.

E.g. in multi-way action, if you have a lower straight draw or Q-high flush draw, you should consider folding, because even if you hit your draw, the odd of another opponent having drawn a better hand is significant.

A good heuristic to apply: **if you can’t value bet confidently even when you hit your draw, you should fold.**

If there is little implied odd or worse, there is reverse implied odd, you should be cautious.

This concept is called **payoff asymmetry**.

There are exceptions to the rule: e.g. your Stack-to-Pot Ratio (SPR) is very low, i.e. you are committed to the pot.

But in general, don’t commit your stack / build big pot if you are not drawing to the nut.

<br /> 

4)

Omaha is a **game of flushes**.

In Hold’em, we don’t hit flush or even flush draw often. But due to having significantly higher hand combinations, we encounter flushes much more in Omaha.

2 pertinent stats for you to intuit this:

1. if you have a double-suited hand, you will flop flush draw 23% of time.
2. if 3 hands collide on a flop, 2 pairs vs flush draw vs 13-card wrap,  flush draw has the highest equity if the other 2 player doesn’t block the flush card.

What this means:

- don’t over-value naked high cards, e.g. AKQJ rainbow when you are deep stacked. It is especially bad if it gets into pre-flop all in against opponent’s AA.
- in Hold’em, we value AQo almost similarly as AQs. But in Omaha, **suited hands go way up in equity and playability**. It is the difference between folding vs going all-in pre-flop.
 
<br />

5)

**Think of 1 “buyin” in Omaha as 3-4 smaller buyins of 100bb bullets.**

The game dynamics and variance is markedly different from Hold’em since equity runs much close in PLO.

Sometimes, the positive EV play is to push your margin-thin equity edge and that means there’s variance involved. In fact, if your variance in Omaha is very low like Hold’em, you are probably not playing it right.

We need to change our intuition and emotional attachment to what a buy-in is, and also adjust our game selection accordingly: e.g. if you are normally a 10/20 NLHE player, you should play 2/5 in PLO.

<br />

6)

**Pre-flop** is the most critical decision in Omaha; it is even **more important in Omaha than in Hold’em.**

According to PLO coach JNandez, there are 3 basic components that making up a good starting PLO hand:

1. High cards
2. Suitedness
3. Connectivity

If your starting hand has all 3 components (e.g. AAKTds, AQJ8ds), you should simply keep building the pot pre-flop.

If you have only 2 of the 3 components (e.g. A963ds, 689Tss), you should see a flop if the pre-flop action is not too heated.

If you have only 1 component (e.g. 3456r, AK45r), just fold and make your life easier.

<br /> 

7)

Push vs Pull hands. Smooth vs Polarised equity.

**Push hands** are hands you want to “push out” other players by re-raising, and lower the SPR, and play heads-up preferably.

- Typically, you want hands with **smooth equity distribution**. That means they can connect to the flop easier (though not necessarily nutted).
- E.g. double suited mid run down (JT97ds).
- Lowering the SPR is critical here, because it allows us to stack off and push (and over-realise) our equity easier when our smooth distribution hits the flop easier.
H- eads-up is preferable because some of our draws (e.g. mid flush draw) are not nutted to play multiway; if we can fold out hands with better flush draw pre-flop, that is a huge equity denial for us.

Pull hands are hands you want to pull as many players into the flop as possible, and have higher SPR on the flop

- these are single-dimensional hands with polarised equity distribution. That means we don’t connect with favorable boards often; but when we do, our hands/draws are nutted.
- E.g. single-suited A, some KK/QQ, double pairs (TT44)
- Hands like A789ds has smooth distribution, but it can also be used as pull hands as well if deep, because your hand has potential to dominate / free-roll another way. And when that happen, you want SPR to be as high as you can.
- We would want to play multi-way with these holdings, because it gives us more chance to cooler another hand (house over house, etc).
 
<br />

8)   miscellaneous topics

__mid run down__

Omaha run-down hands (e.g. 789T) gives us a chance to flop wraps – and wraps are what PLO players dream of.

But beginner PLO players tend to over-value run-downs:

- low run-downs (3456) are deceptively poor in both equity and payoff realization. You find your straight draw often dominated, and you can’t value bet your flushes.
- mid run-down does not play great in a single-raise pot and multi-way;  suited variant of mid run-down should be used as push hands, and off-suit variant should only be played in position.
- don’t overvalue wrap in a flush draw board. Don’t fold, but there is no need to re-raise or even bet on the flop if you are deep.
 
<br />

__backdoor__

Backdoor draws are often insignificant considerations in Hold’em, but they are valued more highly in PLO and you need to be aware of them to avoid under-realising your equity.

Example 1: if you have KQJ9ds, Ten is the **pivot card** you need.

So if flop is T25r, you should absolutely continue to see turn. Any 8/9/J/Q/K/A gives you a wrap.  If you have backdoor flush draw, there’s even more favorable turns.

Example 2: if you have double suited AA, and flop is relatively static (Q73r).

If you have double backdoor flush draw, you need to find a way to see turn (whether check, or bet-calling a raise).

<br />

__position & equity realisability__

In both Hold’em and PLO, position matters, and position helps realise our equity better.

Polarised hands such as (KK33) are easier to play out of position – you can call a single raise from SB and navigate post flop comfortably. You either hit or miss.

Whereas with run-down hands, you much prefer to play in position to better realise your equity. If you are OOP, one way to negate your positional disadvantage is to re-raise and lower the field and SPR.
 
<br />

__board texture and bet sizing__

It is fun to shout “POT!” but a good player knows how to use different bet size effectively.

E.g. on a static and dry board texture (e.g. 944, K72r), if you are betting (value or bluff), you should use a smaller bet size.

On a dynamic board texture i.e. the nut will easily change each street, you should bet pot size as there are more hands that will connect and will pay the bet.

<br /> 

__bluffing__

Bluffing in PLO often involves using “blocker”. Most commonly, bluffing with nut flush blocker, and less commonly, bluffing with house blocker (using 78 on 33789 to fold out straight and trip)

It is not recommended to do pure-air bluff, as opponents have more hand combinations to continue compared to Hold’em.

Some good heuristics to **bluff catching**:

1. if opponent is representing nut flush and is capable of bluffing, you can choose to bluff-catch if the board has 4+ flush cards or if you hold 3+ flush cards, as it lowers the odd of opponent having flush as well
2. it is more likely for an opponent to have nut flush in a single-raised pot versus 3/4bet pots. This is because a common source of unsuited Ace comes from AA; whereas if our opponent just calls a raise pre-flop, he’s more likely to have “pull hands” such as suited Ace.
3. lets say on 33789, if your opponent is representing full house (and full house only) through his actions, if you have relevant blocker (e.g. 79TJ), you should consider calling.
 
<br />

__AA__

When played correctly, AA in PLO should be printing you money.

Categories of starting AAs:

1. platinum tier:
    - double suited AA, single-suited connected AA
    - you can re-pot any position and build a big pot
2. mid tier
    - some suit or some connectivity, e.g. AA96ss, AAJ4ss
    - when in position, just re-raise as normal
    - but when out of position, you need to take note of SPR. If SPR is too high, and there is not many people in the pot, you can flat and proceed cautiously
3. trash tier
    - e.g. AA93r
    - one way to play this is initially keeping the pot small and set mine. But if there are more raises behind you, and if you can commit more than 1/3 of your stack by re-raising, you can stack off with it.
    - another way to play is to fold, which is an option especially appealing if you are deep-stacked
